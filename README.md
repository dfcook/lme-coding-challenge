# LME Coding Challenge

This project was bootstrapped with create-react-app, using the typescript template.

## Pre-requisites
* Node (https://nodejs.org/en/)

## Installation
Clone into a folder and install dependencies

``npm install``
### Development

To run a developer build with hot reloading:

``npm run start:dev``

The app should launch in your browser at http://localhost:3000/

This supports hot reloading of client source.
### Production

To run a production build hosted in an express server:

``npm start``

The server will start and will be available in your browser at http://localhost:3001/

This does not support hot-reloading, source changes will require the server to be restarted.
